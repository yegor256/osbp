  {The inspection is not intended to redesign, evaluate alternate design solutions, or to find solutions to errors; it is intended \ul{just} to find errors!}
  {fagan1976design}

\qte
  [Alberto Bacchelli]
  {alberto-bacchelli}
  {Our results show that, although the top motivation driving code reviews is still finding defects, the practice and the actual outcomes are \ul{less} about finding errors than expected: Defect related comments comprise a small proportion and mainly cover small logical low-level issues.}
  {bacchelli2013expectations}

\qte
  [Mateus Freira dos Santos]
  {mateus-freira-dos-santos}
  {In software projects with less than 34k lines of code, the number of developers that \ul{never contribute again} after receiving a negative comment on the first pull request is 10.97\%; this number more than doubles to 24.02\% when evaluating projects with more than 197k lines of code.}

  [Andrew Sutherland]
  {andrew-sutherland}
  {The meat of the code review dialog, no matter what the medium, is the articulation of design rationale... Engineers find code review dialogs useful for a variety of purposes, but for understanding design rationale more than any other.}
  {sutherland2009can}

\qte
  [Frank A. Ackerman]
  {frank-ackerman}
  {Regardless of the application or the language, you can expect inspections to find from seven to 20 major \ul{defects} per thousand noncomment lines of source code and to find major defects at a \ul{cost} of one to five staff-hours.}
  {ackerman1989software}

\qte
  [Caitlin Sadowski]
  {caitlin-sadowski}
  {As developers build experience working at Google, the average number of comments on their changes decreases... Developers at Google who have started within the past year typically have more than twice as many comments per change.}
  {sadowski2018modern}

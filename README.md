**THE COURSE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

There are slides for my series of lectures for [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/) (Kazan, Russia).

<!-- All recorded videos (so far) are in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08x_T-Aelduv3Zf0DWRx40pq). -->

All compiled slide decks in PDF are [here](https://yegor256.github.io/osbp/).

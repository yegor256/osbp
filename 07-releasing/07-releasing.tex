  {Simply \ul{making available} and retrieving interdependent components individually \ul{neither} facilitates independent software development \ul{nor} encourages widespread use of large systems of systems.}
  {van1997software}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{G{\"u}nther Ruhe}]
  {gunther-ruhe}
  {Release planning is typically done \textit{ad hoc} and \ul{not} based on sound \ul{models and methodologies}. This is even the case when planning involves several hundred features.}
  {ruhe2005art}

\lnThought{Release when it's different, not when it's good.}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Kazu Okumoto}]
  {kazu-okumoto}
  {\textbf{\nospell{Goel-Okumoto} model}: An important problem of practical concern is the determination of the point when testing should \ul{stop} and the system can be considered ready for release, that is, the determination of the \ul{software release time}. Two criteria are investigated: software reliability and total expected cost.}
  {okumoto1979optimum}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Shigeru Yamada}]
  {shigeru-yamada}
  {This paper extends the problem of \citet{okumoto1979optimum} by evaluating \ul{both criteria} simultaneously. We discuss optimal software release policies which minimize a total average software cost under the constraint of satisfying a software reliability requirement.}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Steve McConnell}]
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {The question of whether to release software is a treacherous one. The answer must teeter on the line between releasing poor quality software early and releasing high quality software late. The questions of `Is the software good enough to release now?' and `When will the software be good enough to release?' can become critical to a companyâ€™s survival.}
  {mcconnell1998}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Nasif Imtiaz}]
  {nasif-imtiaz}
  {We find that the open source packages are typically fast in releasing security fixes, as the median release comes within \ul{4 days} of the corresponding security fix. However, 25\% of the releases still have a delay of at least \ul{20 days}.}
  {imtiaz2022open}

\lnThought{Fully automate the release process, avoiding any manual intervention.}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Michael Nygard}]
  {michael-nygard}
  {Releases should be about as big an event as getting a \ul{haircut}. There's an added benefit of frequent releases: it forces you to get really good at doing releases and deployments.}
  {nygard2007release}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Jez Humble}]
  {jez-humble}
  {Over time, deployments should tend towards being fully automated. There should be \ul{two tasks} for a human being to perform to deploy software into a development, test, or production environment: to pick the version and environment and to press the `deploy' button.}
  {humble2010continuous}

\lnThought{Release frequently.}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Victor Basili}]
  {victor-basili}
  {If improving productivity is the main concern, then it may be wise to try to \ul{avoid} scheduling \ul{small} error correction releases. Instead the manager should try, when possible, to \ul{package} small error corrections in a release with larger enhancements.

  {foutse-khomh}
  {We found that (1)~with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more post-release bugs and (2)~bugs are fixed faster, yet (3)~users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier).}

  ``The implication of semantic versioning is that clients may rely on dependencies subject to flexible version constraints, like \texttt{1.2.*}. Such a client may safely upgrade to new micro versions (e.g., from \texttt{1.2.3} to \texttt{1.2.4}), fully automated.''

  {jianyu-wu}
  {We find that: 1) RN producers are more likely to miss information than to include incorrect information, especially for breaking changes; 2) improper layout may bury important information and confuse users; 3) many users find RNs inaccessible due to link deterioration, lack of notification, and obfuscate RN locations; 4) automating and regulating RN production remains challenging despite the great needs of RN producers.}

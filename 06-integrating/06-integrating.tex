  {We start by collecting a set of 84,475 open-source Android apps from the most popular three online code hosting sites, namely Github, GitLab, and Bitbucket. We then look into those apps and find that only around 10\% of apps have leveraged CI/CD services, i.e., the \ul{majority} of open-source Android apps are developed \ul{without} accessing CI/CD services.}

  ``A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the \ul{combinations} of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems.''

  {We observe that developers restart at least 1.72\% of builds, amounting to 56,522 restarted builds in our Travis CI dataset. We observe that more \ul{mature} and more \ul{complex} projects are more likely to include restarted builds. The restarted builds are mostly builds that are initially failing due to a \ul{test}, \ul{network problem}, or a Travis CI \ul{limitations} such as execution timeout.}

  {Pope Francis offered some Valentineâ€™s Day advice Friday for a lasting marriage, telling 25,000 \ul{lovebirds} that the recipe for success lies in saying three simple words: `\ul{Please}, \ul{thanks} and \ul{sorry}.'{}}

  {We found that the level of a submitter's prior interaction on a project changed how \ul{politely} developers discussed the contribution and the nature of proposed alternative solutions.}

  {Avatars that were more \ul{anthropomorphic} were perceived to be more \ul{attractive} and \ul{credible}. The strongest predictor of these variables, however, was the degree of masculinity or femininity (lack of androgyny) of an avatar.}

  {Our results show that there is \ul{gravity} in online collaborations on GitHub. Traditional determinants of international trade such as \ul{language barriers} and \ul{country borders} matter for international code contributions.}

  {The \ul{conflict} exerted a strong and persistent negative effect on the overall
  Ukrainian-Russian collaboration as measured by Ukrainian contributions
  to Russian projects and vice versa. The effect is \ul{symmetric} on the extensive margin.
  However, on the intensive margine, Ukrainian programmers react stronger: conditional
  on collaborating with Russians, they contribute to \ul{fewer} Russian projects.}
